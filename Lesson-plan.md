## ML Sci-prog 

### Types of ML
- Regression
- Classification
- Unsupervised learning
- Jobs, kaggle competitions, etc.

### First lesson - Regression
- Quizzes on what type of problem this is
- training vs. testing data
- Overfitting - Show visuals, or we could fabricate a demo with a sine wave - Jordan
- step size - Demo/Visual?
- Cross validation - Scikit learn libraries
- Single variable regression - Maybe include demo of overfitting
- Multi-variable regression
- Go up to more variables

## Classifcation
- optional if time

## Description
- High level overview of what machine learning is.
- Overview of regression and how it works
- Build your first regression model in python with sci-kit learn
- Learn about what is available to you
- understand considerations to fine tune your model
- If time classification
