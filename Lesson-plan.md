## ML Sci-prog 

### Types of ML
- Regression
- Classification
- Unsupervised learning
- Jobs, kaggle competitions

### First lesson - Regression
- Quizzes on what type of problem this is
- training vs. testing data
- Overfitting - Show visuals, or we could fabricate a demo with a sine wave - Jordan
- step size - Demo/Visual?
- Cross validation - Scikit learn libraries
- Single variable regression - Maybe include demo of overfitting
- Multi-variable regression
- Go up to more variables
