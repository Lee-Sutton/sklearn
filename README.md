# Intro to Machine Learning with Python and Scikit learn 
This repository contains the code, data, and lesson plan for the Intro to Machine Learning with Python course delivered to the scientific programming group at Simon Fraser University.

## Workshop Description
**Python Machine Learning Bootcamp: Your First Machine Learning Steps with Regression**

In this introductory look at Machine Learning  you will learn about the different types of Machine Learning models and build your first regression model. You'll learn about some of the considerations to fine-tune your model and improve convergence. We'll also show you some great online resources to learn about new ML models and get great example code for your own projects.

*This workshop is intended for users who are new to Machine Learning. Users should already have installed Python 2 or Python 3 before this session.*

## Future Lessons:
Send us an email at lmsutton@sfu.ca or jdlui@sfu.ca if you are interested in future sessions!

Some future SciProg  workshops in Machine Learning may include:
- logistic regression/classification + SVM
- clustering
- neural networks
- decision trees + random forest +  boosting + bagging
- SVD/PCA
- Deep Learning

### Useful links for your Machine Learning adventures:
#### Scikit Learn
Great community for learning about new python libraries for Machine Learning

http://scikit-learn.org/stable/

#### Greg Mori's Machine Learning Course
Great introduction to various types of Machine Learning. This will also help to flex your math muscles and approach ML problems with more method.
